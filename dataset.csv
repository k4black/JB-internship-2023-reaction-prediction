I think what everyone is getting at - is that the Kindle shouldnt replace hard copy books entirely - it just provides a level of useflness that outdoes hard-copy books, hands down!

Oh, not to mention you can bookmark, highlight, add notes, and you have a BUILT IN dictionary -- and you dont have to defile your book like you would your hard copy to put notes and highlights in. Hands down, the Kindle is better.

Yes its the kindle site but Im not an amazon rep restricted to advertising the product and avoiding discussion of its pros and cons.  It has many good points but theres room for improvement. This is a good place to voice concerns and suggestions from which other readers may benefit.  For me, reading for too long off the kindle gives me a headache and  the $12 clip on light mentioned by somebody causes glare on my screen and eyestrain  despite angle adjustments. The effects are similar to  staring at a computer screen at length. If anyone has suggestions on how to correct this, this forum is the place to do it.
